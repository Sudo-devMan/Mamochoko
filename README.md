  This website is free to use for anyone in the world. However, you can only log in as an admin if you have the admin root password. You can ask for the password in-person at the school if you are a member of the staff. Other people who choose to login can upload resources and update their profiles. Making this website was not easy and also was not hard, it was just another Friday in the office (not that I made it all in one day). By Hendrick Mashamaite, (first developed in 2024 when he was 15).
